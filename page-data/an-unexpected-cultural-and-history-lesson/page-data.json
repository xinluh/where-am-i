As I’ve quickly learned, plans in the time of coronavirus not only cannot be set in stone - they might as well be sands getting blown in the wind. So as the national parks closed and friend-meeting got cancelled, I grabbed onto the closest thing open near Albuquerque: Petroglyph &#x26; Bandalier National Monuments.</p>\n<p>As luck has it, this unexpected turn of event set me down a 3 day journey to discover and learn about the history and incredible architecture of the ancestral Puebloans - a word I don’t recall ever seeing before, not to mention knowing anything about.</p>\n<p>With spotty-or-non-existent internet along the way, I had the joy of discovering new information the old-fashioned way without the help of Google (or from all the closed visitor centers/museums due to coronavirus). It was like solving a puzzle: after seeing many ruins in different places, I started to notice similarities/unusual features, and missing pieces in one ruin would make a lot of sense after seeing the next ruin. After I visited the final stop of this journey, Mesa Verde National Park with its excellent explanatory signage, the puzzle pieces were coming together in a most satisfactory way. Such is the joy of making the best out of the unexpected!</p>\n<p>Some highlights:</p>\n<p>I came to Bandalier National Monument with zero expectation (only because it is open), so imagine my delight when I saw this at the end of a pleasant but unremarkable hike:\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

In my (clearly biased) worldview right now, completely shutting down national parks seem like <del>an extreme reaction</del> <em>[edit: just read the actual news article in now that I have internet instead of reacting to the headline: seems like Yellowstone etc. may have different visitor pattern than what I’ve seen in other parks. If that is true, perhaps shutdown makes sense]</em>, instead of simply shuttering all lodging options to discourage crowd forming. Gloomy thoughts in my mind tonight as I found out that Yellowstone and Grand Teton are joining the ever growing list of closed places, but at least I have this starry night to comfort me:\n<img src=\"/11a3d6d878fb25cf3fa6de4be49214a2/DSC01243.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Unexpected Cultural and History Lesson","date":"March 25, 2020","description":""}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates-courtesy-of-coronavirus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updates, courtesy of coronavirus"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/san-juan-skyway-colorado/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"San Juan Skyway, Colorado"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f4dceb0b-e603-59e4-ad5e-558b8abb5379","previousPostId":"aabcce2e-501e-52cc-9d11-4441ca6d9c24","nextPostId":"b115d079-5de1-54af-95fc-09e05abb8ab1"}},
