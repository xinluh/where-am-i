The ski resort where I’ve been skiing this week is now closed (a quick turn of event - just this morning, Vail Resorts sent an email stating that resorts would in fact stay open, but with reduced operations and encouragement of social distancing). Depending on how obsessively one follows the news, it seems like the world is spiraling into panic mode.</p>\n<p>All that is to say, the situation took a drastic turn for the worse in a very short time. I thought I was mentally prepared for the power of exponential growth, but the reactions by ordinary people, organizations, governments, etc. still took me by surprise. With foresight I would certainly choose a different time to do some long term travelling, but no point in wondering about “what could have happened if I have known…” - unexpected hairpin turns are part of why life is so interesting anyways!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the US is vast and barely inhabited outside of the coasts. Road trip with long stretches of driving are effectively self-quarantine. I’ll make the best of the situation by being flexible - for once, time is on my side. Hopefully the backcountry of the national parks remains accessible…</p>\n<p>Onward!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Travel in the Time of Coronavirus","date":"March 15, 2020","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/travel-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/utah-highway-12-and-zebra-slot-canyon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Utah Highway 12 and Zebra Slot Canyon"}}}}}
