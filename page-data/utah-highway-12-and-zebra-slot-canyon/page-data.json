I was a bit concerned about the unpaved road condition after the rain yesterday, but it turned out okay. We had just a tantalizing glimpse of the “Zebra” part of the slot canyon - the water level in the slot canyon was high, and we turned back about 50 ft beyond the canyon entrance, after wading through above-waist-high cold muddy water. Would love to come back and explore further, when the water level gets low enough so swimming is not required!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Utah Highway 12 and Zebra Slot Canyon","date":"March 16, 2020","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/utah-highway-12-and-zebra-slot-canyon/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/travel-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Travel in the Time of Coronavirus"}},"next":null}}}
