They were still open as of yesterday… With these closures, my itinerary in southern New Mexico will be cut short - the second major change of plan due to COVID-19 (the first was the closure of ski resorts). New plan: visit the nearby national monuments, stay close to nature, and learn more about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ancestral_Puebloan_dwellings_in_New_Mexico\">prehistoric dwellings</a> in New Mexico that I didn’t know about until today.</p>\n<p>I was aware that it would be a matter of time before the closure of visitor-facing facilities of national parks, as park representatives would be facing disproportional amount of risk interacting with guests from all over the country. However, I really hope that nature remains open: social distancing and quarantine don’t necessarily mean staying isolated indoor; in fact, being outdoor in nature might very well be necessary to keep us sane through challenging times (outdoor recreation <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-is-it-legal-to-go-hiking/\">was defined as “essential activity” </a> in Bay Area shelter-in-place orders;\nScott Kelly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/scott-kelly-coronavirus-isolation.html\">encourages us to step outside</a>).</p>\n<p>Thankfully, many - but not all - parks seem to be making arrangements such that the nature remains accessible while keeping their personnel and visitors safe. I’ll stay on the road and be in nature as long as this remains true - and, of course, as long as what I do does not post danger to others and myself. Planning and logistics will be challenging, as new closure notices are updated by the day, if not by the hour.</p>\n<p>On coronavirus related notes,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ad by roadside: “Place an order for pizzas for more than $19.99 - get one roll of toilet paper for free”</li>\n<li>We overheard staff of a popular local restaurant in Flagstaff discussing raising prices on menu items with egg because they could not get eggs from their suppliers or in any local markets</li>\n<li>Olive Garden waitress: “our to-go system was not quite ready but we now have no options but to work out the kinks”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On non-coronavirus related notes,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em> was a memorable inspiration to my younger, impressionable self, and I was excited to see signs for “Historical Route 66” all along the road from Flagstaff to Albuqueque.
