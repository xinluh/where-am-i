&lt;p&gt;As of today, 1 week into my trip, the US is in a state of emergency with mass closures of everything from schools to Broadway. The ski resort where I’ve been skiing this week is now closed (a quick turn of event - just this morning, Vail Resorts sent an email stating that resorts would in fact stay open, but with reduced operations and encouragement of social distancing). Depending on how obsessive one follows the news, it seems like the world is spiraling into panic mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is to say, the situation took a drastic turn for the worse in a very short time. I thought I was mentally prepared for the power of exponential growth, but the reactions by ordinary people, organizations, governments, etc. still took me by surprise. With foresight I would certainly choose a different time to do some long term travelling, but no point in wondering about “what could have happened if I have known…” - unexpected hairpin turns are part of why life is so interesting anyways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the US is vast and barely inhabited outside of the coasts. I’ll make the best of the situation - hopefully the backcountry of the national parks remains accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[I might write something here from time to time.]]></description><link>http://xinluh.github.io/where-am-i/hello-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://xinluh.github.io/where-am-i/hello-world/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I might write something here from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
