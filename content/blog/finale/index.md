This is it, folks! 3 long days of driving and 1600 miles later, my (star-crossed?) road trip came to an early end today. Closures and travel restrictions caused by coronavirus are making staying on the road untenable, even if I remain careful to maintain social distancing to keep others and myself safe.

As much as I tried to pay attention, some states I drove by more or less blended into each other -- sorry, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio... Political boundaries aside, it was a treat to see the dramatic landscape changes from South Dakota to the East Coast gradually unfolding before my eyes:
- Wild prairie and open ranch of western South Dakota became expansive corn fields by eastern South Dakota.
- Southern Minnesota is more or less flat corn fields extending to the horizon as far as the eyes can see. True to Minnesota's moniker of "Land of 10,000 Lakes," small lakes help to break up the monotony of corn fields -- so do the occasional picturesque towns like Pipestone, MN.
- At the Minnesota/Wisconsin boundary I crossed the Mississippi River -- an exciting moment for me, as Mississippi River is steeped in rich historical and cultural significance, and seeing it in person is akin to meeting a celebrity in real life.
- I took a small detour at this point to follow the [Great River Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_River_Road) south along the Mississippi River until Dubuque, Iowa. In between towns that seem well-oiled for tourism, flat corn fields turned into rolling hills of corn fields. I noted the French influence in the town names (e.g. _Prairie du Chien_, _La Crosse_)
- Except for the traffic around Chicago and a pleasant stop at Indiana Dunes at the south tip of Lake Michigan, the next 500 miles or so were remarkably unremarkable -- corn fields after another corn field. The traffic around Chicago was incredibly stressful, with trucks passing each other aggressively and cars driving over 20 mph above speed limit. With shelter-in-place orders in effect hopefully reducing the number of cars on the road, it is hard to imagine how much worse it can get with normal amount of traffic.
- Somewhere around Pittsburgh, the landscape slowly became more forested, and before I realized to put a name to it, I was in the Appalachian Mountains. Signage on the highway for a pedestrian overpass helpfully reminded me that I just crossed the Appalachian Trail (!). Appalachia was so much in my mind for political reasons recently that I almost forgot how beautiful the region is. Despite the overcast sky and trees still in their winter form with bare branches, it was a magnificent sight to see mountains upon mountains of densely forested land.

Going south toward Maryland, I realized that I have finally arrived in spring. Growing up, this was my favorite time of the year: trees, shrubbery, and grass alike bloom into flowers in a kaleidoscope of colors -- all shades of white, red, yellow, purple -- amidst the delicate green of new leaves coming out of the dormant winter. I have hoped to see spring somewhere else during this trip, perhaps in the Rockies Mountains, but the coronavirus thwarted my plan. At least as a consolation prize, spring anywhere is still spring and brings with it its unfailing hopefulness.

Let's hope, indeed, that this trip will resume in a point not too far in the future!
